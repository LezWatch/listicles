Create beautiful listicle blocks.

== Description ==

The listicles plugin creates interactive blocks for generating lists in articles. Unlike traditional lists (like `ul` and `li`) a listicle is intended to provide each section with a header, and multiple paragraphs per section.

With this plugin you can insert images, videos, and more inside each list item. The limit is your imagination.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many list items can I make? =

Unlimited, though personally I would recommend 20 or less. Unless you're BuzzFeed.
