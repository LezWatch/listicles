Create beautiful listicle blocks.

== Description ==

Be the next BuzzFeed! The listicles plugin creates interactive blocks for generating lists in articles. Unlike traditional lists that use `ul` and `li`, a listicle is intended to provide each section with a header and multiple paragraphs per section.

With this plugin you can insert images, videos, and more inside each list item. The limit is your imagination.

This plugin was originally created for use on [LezWatch.TV](https://lezwatchtv.com).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many list items can I make? =

Unlimited, though personally I would recommend 20 or less. Unless you're BuzzFeed.

= How can I format the listicle title? =

You can use bold, italics, strikethrough, and links.

= What content can I put in the listicle content? =

Anything except another listicle. This prevents listception.

= How do I add an item? =

Press the "Add Item" button at the bottom of your listicle.

= How do I reverse the order? =

Press the "Toggle Order" button at the bottom of the listicle, or when your whole listicle block is selected, turn on the 'Reversed' setting.

= Can I move items within the listicle? =

Yes! The same way you move any blocks.

= The style is pretty bare, can I edit it? =

You can edit it via custom CSS on your site.
